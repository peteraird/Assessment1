     <h2> <b>Hi, Pete, here from Tassie.</b> </h2>
<p>I have a beautiful partner, Keryn and a 6year old son, Flynn, a cat named Spot and a Chocolate Lab Called Coco, and I'm very much a sci-fi junkie.
I work full-time Monday to Friday as a Territory Manager for The Arnott's Group.
I also work part-time for Tassiecare in Disability Support as a Direct Service Coordinator and Tech Support.
For my Arnott's job, I'm managed out of NSW. I do a lot of zoom meetings, work with Microsoft Office and Salesforce. I have a small team of three Representatives working under me, right across the north of the state. I'm a part of the field tech team and have already helped roll out different tech projects across Australia and New Zealand.

   <h2><b> Interest in IT </b></h2>
     <artical>
     I enjoy working with technology, and I'm only self-taught. I am looking to do a Bachelor of Information Technology, which is why I'm doing this course. I have a genuine interest, and I'm curious about IT. When I think about what I like about IT, I would have to say it's helping others. It's looking at what problems people have with technology and helping them to use it and learn. There is nothing like the gratitude that you receive when you've helped someone figure out how to do that thing, that they may have been struggling with. The smile on their face says it all. An example of this would be when I helped roll out training courses and videos on using new software and cloud services. While making the training videos, I kept the end-user in mind the entire time, making sure it was easy to follow and understand.

       <p> Information and Communication Technology Manager 
 <p>Respect Group Limited

  <artical>
   This position would be a management role within the organization. You would be responsible for training and managing staff, their tech systems and tech information.
I would also hope you would be working with the organization's participants, who may have a disability and need help to embrace technology. 
Some skills that will be required for this role.
 Knowledge of general IT, a qualification in IT, and the systems they may use, managing a team, meeting deadlines, good problem-solving skills and time management. A history of working with people with disabilities and the vulnerable.
Except for IT qualification and knowing the current systems, I feel I have the required experience for this role from my two current roles. 
I need to complete a Bachelor of Information Technology. 
I will learn the required skills needed for the role, like computer science, communicating effectively with others, solving IT problems, designing software applications and IT systems, and teaching me to handle and help people from a diverse background and life circumstances, all of them with different levels of tech experience. Helping me understand the legal issues, privacy issues, and ethical standards related to IT, which I feel would be very important, especially working with people with disabilities and the vulnerable.

 <p><artical>
•	Creative – Advocate personalities enjoy finding the perfect solution for the people they care about. To do this, they draw on their vivid imagination and their strong sense of compassion. This can make them excellent counsellors and advisors.
•	Insightful – Advocates typically strive to move past appearances and get to the heart of things. This can give them an almost uncanny ability to understand people’s true motivations, feelings, and needs.
•	Principled – People with the Advocate personality type tend to have deeply held beliefs, and their conviction often shines through when they speak or write about subjects that matter to them. Advocates can be compelling and inspiring communicators, with their idealism persuading even the hardest of sceptics.
•	Passionate – Advocates can pursue their ideals with a single-mindedness that may catch others off guard. These personalities rarely settle for “good enough,” and their willingness to disrupt the status quo may not please everyone. That said, Advocates’ passion for their chosen cause is a key aspect of their personality.
•	Altruistic – Advocates generally aim to use their strengths for the greater good – they rarely enjoy succeeding at other people’s expense. They tend to think about how their actions affect others, and their goal is to behave in a way that will help the people around them and make the world a better place.

Visual
</artical>
  <artical>
 If you are a visual learner, you learn by reading or seeing pictures. You understand and remember things by sight. You can picture what you are learning in your head, and you learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning.
As a visual learner, you are usually neat and clean. You often close your eyes to visualize or remember something, and you will find something to watch if you become bored. You may have difficulty with spoken directions and may be easily distracted by sounds. You are attracted to colour and to spoken language (like stories) that is rich in imagery.
