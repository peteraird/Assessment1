    <p> Hi, Pete, here from Tassie.
<p>I have a beautiful partner, Keryn and a 6year old son, Flynn, a cat named Spot and a Chocolate Lab Called Coco, and I'm very much a sci-fi junkie.
I work full-time Monday to Friday as a Territory Manager for The Arnott's Group.
I also work part-time for Tassiecare in Disability Support as a Direct Service Coordinator and Tech Support.
For my Arnott's job, I'm managed out of NSW. I do a lot of zoom meetings, work with Microsoft Office and Salesforce. I have a small team of three Representatives working under me, right across the north of the state. I'm a part of the field tech team and have already helped roll out different tech projects across Australia and New Zealand.

   <h2><b> Interest in IT</h2>
     <artical>
     I enjoy working with technology, and I'm only self-taught. I am looking to do a Bachelor of Information Technology, which is why I'm doing this course. I have a genuine interest, and I'm curious about IT. When I think about what I like about IT, I would have to say it's helping others. It's looking at what problems people have with technology and helping them to use it and learn. There is nothing like the gratitude that you receive when you've helped someone figure out how to do that thing, that they may have been struggling with. The smile on their face says it all. An example of this would be when I helped roll out training courses and videos on using new software and cloud services. While making the training videos, I kept the end-user in mind the entire time, making sure it was easy to follow and understand.
