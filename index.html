     <h2> <b>Hi, Pete, here from Tassie.</b> </h2>
<p>I have a beautiful partner, Keryn and a 6year old son, Flynn, a cat named Spot and a Chocolate Lab Called Coco, and I'm very much a sci-fi junkie.
I work full-time Monday to Friday as a Territory Manager for The Arnott's Group.
I also work part-time for Tassiecare in Disability Support as a Direct Service Coordinator and Tech Support.
For my Arnott's job, I'm managed out of NSW. I do a lot of zoom meetings, work with Microsoft Office and Salesforce. I have a small team of three Representatives working under me, right across the north of the state. I'm a part of the field tech team and have already helped roll out different tech projects across Australia and New Zealand.

   <h2><b> Interest in IT </b></h2>
     <artical>
     I enjoy working with technology, and I'm only self-taught. I am looking to do a Bachelor of Information Technology, which is why I'm doing this course. I have a genuine interest, and I'm curious about IT. When I think about what I like about IT, I would have to say it's helping others. It's looking at what problems people have with technology and helping them to use it and learn. There is nothing like the gratitude that you receive when you've helped someone figure out how to do that thing, that they may have been struggling with. The smile on their face says it all. An example of this would be when I helped roll out training courses and videos on using new software and cloud services. While making the training videos, I kept the end-user in mind the entire time, making sure it was easy to follow and understand.

       <img src="job.jpg"/> <style> img { width: 200px; border-radius:10px; } </style>
       <p> Information and Communication Technology Manager 
 <p>Respect Group Limited

   This position would be a management role within the organization. You would be responsible for training and managing staff, their tech systems and tech information.
I would also hope you would be working with the organization's participants, who may have a disability and need help to embrace technology. 
Some skills that will be required for this role.
 Knowledge of general IT, a qualification in IT, and the systems they may use, managing a team, meeting deadlines, good problem-solving skills and time management. A history of working with people with disabilities and the vulnerable.
Except for IT qualification and knowing the current systems, I feel I have the required experience for this role from my two current roles. 
I need to complete a Bachelor of Information Technology. 
I will learn the required skills needed for the role, like computer science, communicating effectively with others, solving IT problems, designing software applications and IT systems, and teaching me to handle and help people from a diverse background and life circumstances, all of them with different levels of tech experience. Helping me understand the legal issues, privacy issues, and ethical standards related to IT, which I feel would be very important, especially working with people with disabilities and the vulnerable.
