    <p> Hi, Pete, here from Tassie.
<p>I have a beautiful partner, Keryn and a 6year old son, Flynn, a cat named Spot and a Chocolate Lab Called Coco, and I'm very much a sci-fi junkie.
<p>I work full-time Monday to Friday as a Territory Manager for The Arnott's Group.
<p>I also work part-time for Tassiecare in Disability Support as a Direct Service Coordinator and Tech Support.
<p>For my Arnott's job, I'm managed out of NSW. I do a lot of zoom meetings, work with Microsoft Office and Salesforce. I have a small team of three Representatives working under me, right across the north of the state. I'm a part of the field tech team and have already helped roll out different tech projects across Australia and New Zealand.
